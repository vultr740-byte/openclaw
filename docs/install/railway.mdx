title: Deploy on Railway
---

Deploy OpenClaw on Railway with a one-click template and finish setup in your browser.
This is the easiest “no terminal on the server” path: Railway runs the Gateway for you,
and you configure everything via the `/setup` web wizard.

## Quick checklist (new users)

1. Click **Deploy on Railway** (below).
2. Add a **Volume** mounted at `/data`.
3. Set the required **Variables** (at least `SETUP_PASSWORD`).
4. Enable **HTTP Proxy** on port `8080`.
5. Open `https://<your-railway-domain>/setup` and finish the wizard.

## One-click deploy

<a href="https://railway.com/deploy/clawdbot-railway-template" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  Deploy on Railway
</a>

After deploy, find your public URL in **Railway → your service → Settings → Domains**.

Railway will either:

- give you a generated domain (often `https://<something>.up.railway.app`), or
- use your custom domain if you attached one.

Then open:

- `https://<your-railway-domain>/setup` — setup wizard (password protected)
- `https://<your-railway-domain>/openclaw` — Control UI

## What you get

- Hosted OpenClaw Gateway + Control UI
- Web setup wizard at `/setup` (no terminal commands)
- Persistent storage via Railway Volume (`/data`) so config/credentials/workspace survive redeploys
- Backup export at `/setup/export` to migrate off Railway later

## Required Railway settings

### Public Networking

Enable **HTTP Proxy** for the service.

- Port: `8080`

### Volume (required)

Attach a volume mounted at:

- `/data`

### Variables

Set these variables on the service:

- `SETUP_PASSWORD` (required)
- `PORT=8080` (required — must match the port in Public Networking)
- `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=/data/.openclaw` (recommended)
- `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR=/data/workspace` (recommended)
- `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` (recommended; treat as an admin secret)

## Env only setup (skip /setup)

If you want a fully automated deploy with no in-browser setup, use the config
template + env variables path. The entrypoint will create
`$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/openclaw.json` on first boot.

Add these variables:

- `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_TEMPLATE=/app/config/openclaw.railway.template.json`
- `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_TEMPLATE_FORCE=1` (optional; overwrite existing config)
- `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_BIND=lan`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL`
- `OPENAI_API_MODE=openai-responses` (or `openai-completions` if your proxy requires it)
- `OPENAI_MODEL` (example: `gpt-5.2`)
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
- `TELEGRAM_ALLOW_FROM` (comma-separated Telegram user ids, or set `TELEGRAM_ALLOW_FROM_JSON` to a JSON array)

Notes:

- The template sets Telegram to `dmPolicy: "allowlist"`, so no pairing codes are used.
- If `TELEGRAM_ALLOW_FROM` (or JSON variant) is empty, Telegram DMs are blocked.
- Missing env vars referenced in the template will block startup.
- To change the model or allowlist later, update the env vars and redeploy.

## Setup flow

1. Visit `https://<your-railway-domain>/setup` and enter your `SETUP_PASSWORD`.
2. Choose a model/auth provider and paste your key.
3. (Optional) Add Telegram/Discord/Slack tokens.
4. Click **Run setup**.

If Telegram DMs are set to pairing, the setup wizard can approve the pairing code.

## Getting chat tokens

### Telegram bot token

1. Message `@BotFather` in Telegram
2. Run `/newbot`
3. Copy the token (looks like `123456789:AA...`)
4. Paste it into `/setup`

### Discord bot token

1. Go to [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. **New Application** → choose a name
3. **Bot** → **Add Bot**
4. **Enable MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT** under Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents (required or the bot will crash on startup)
5. Copy the **Bot Token** and paste into `/setup`
6. Invite the bot to your server (OAuth2 URL Generator; scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`)

## Backups & migration

Download a backup at:

- `https://<your-railway-domain>/setup/export`

This exports your OpenClaw state + workspace so you can migrate to another host without losing config or memory.
